Code for our COLING2020 paper "Making the Best Use of Review Summary for Sentiment Analysis"

### Before you can run the code
- The requried packages can be found in packages.txt
- The SNAP Amazon dataset can be obtained from [this url](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html) (We cannot provide the data in our repo due to copyright issue. )
- The dataset path in the config file needs to be correctly assigned. 

### Run the code:
`python main.py --config config_toy`
- /param/config_toy.py is just an example config file. You may create your own config file.
